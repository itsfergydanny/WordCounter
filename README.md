# WordCounter

<br>

Requirements: 
* Java 17
* Maven

Hi, here is my solution for the assessment. You can compile the project using Maven by running the following while in the project root folder:
```shell
mvn package
```

<br>


Once compiled, you have two options when it comes to running the jar. One is that you provide the file path as an argument, for example:
```shell
java -jar ./target/WordCounter-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar test.txt
```

<br>

The second option is by simply running the jar and then typing the file path and hitting enter:
```shell
java -jar ./target/WordCounter-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar
```
